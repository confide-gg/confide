## Introduction

Confide is an open-source, encrypted chat platform. It offers a familiar interface similar to modern community chat apps, but with a focus on privacy and user control.

The architecture is designed to be flexible:
- **Friends & DMs**: Managed centrally for a seamless experience.
- **Community Servers**: Fully federated. You can host your own server to maintain complete ownership of your data and community.

For complete isolation, the Central Server itself is also open-source and self-hostable. Confide provides the modern chat experience you expect, without the tracking.

## Contributing
